# CIMB-MVQA: Causal Intervention on Modality-specific Biases for Medical Visual Question Answering

## Overview

Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) aims to combine medical image understanding with clinical language reasoning, enabling automatic answering of natural language questions grounded on medical images. Recent progress in deep learning has achieved impressive results on Med-VQA benchmarks; however, existing models still suffer from spurious correlations caused by data bias and structural confounders in both the visual and language modalities. These biases compromise the model’s robustness and generalization in realistic clinical environments.

This repository provides the official implementation of **CIMB-MVQA**, a modality-specific causal intervention framework for Med-VQA. CIMB-MVQA addresses cross-modal bias by explicitly modeling and adjusting for confounding factors. Our method combines causal intervention, contrastive representation learning, feature disentanglement, dual semantic masking, and a vision-guided pseudo-token injection mechanism to achieve higher answer accuracy, better causal interpretability, and stronger robustness against distribution shifts. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/cloneiq/CIMB-MVQA. The overall architecture of the proposed method is depicted in the figure below.

## Data Preparation

### Datasets

1. Download the datasets.
   1. SLAKE: An English-Chinese bilingual Med-VQA benchmark containing 642 radiology images (CT, MRI, X-ray) and 14 ,028 question-answer pairs, plus pixel-level masks and a medical knowledge graph; download: https://www.med-vqa.com/slake/.
   2. VQA RAD: A clinician-curated dataset built from MedPix that provides 315 radiology images and 3 ,515 question-answer pairs for visual question answering; download: https://osf.io/89kps/.  
   3. MedVQA 2019: The ImageCLEF 2019 challenge corpus with 3 ,200 training images (12 ,792 QA), 500 validation images (2 ,000 QA) and 500 test images (500 questions) covering modality, plane, organ and abnormality queries; download: https://zenodo.org/record/10499039
2. Place the files under the `data/` directory.
